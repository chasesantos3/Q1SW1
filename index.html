	<ul> 
<li>1.) Their music is mostly instrumental, and the way they do and play their instruments always feels like the instruments are talking to each other. </li>

<li>2.) This is the music for anyone looking to have a good time but isnâ€™t afraid to get vulnerable, who is willing to confront the dark parts of life and party on anyway, because Chase Atlantic is here to get in your face, to get real, and to have a great time while doing it. </li>
